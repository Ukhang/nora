### Custom Duration

Adjust the `duration` prop to control how fast or slow the loader animation plays.

```tsx
<Nora duration={2000} />
```

### Theme Adaptation
Control the theme of the loader manually by setting the theme prop to `'light'`, `'dark'` or `'system'`.
```tsx
<Nora theme="dark" />
```
